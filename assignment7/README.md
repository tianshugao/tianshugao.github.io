    Notes: 
  1. I put a sidebar in the webpage, but the button above it cannot shown up because of the security interception of browser. If I choose to allow it to load, then the chart cannot show up after click the "show total" button for some reason. I am wondering that if this problem can be solved. 
  2. The webpage will scroll if you click the nav bar. However, it can only scroll after showing the bar chart for the original webpage is too short.
